# Wasted Bank Space
Plugin to show what items in your bank can be stored elsewhere in Gielinor, to save you bank space.

# How it works
After the player visits their Bank the plugin places a yellow caution sign, and tooltip on the items in their bank which could be stored elsewhere.

Additionally, a panel can be seen on the right-hand side of RuneLite by selecting the yellow caution sign. This shows a list of all of the items, a count of the items which may be wasting your banks space, and finaly a list of further tips to save bank space (some will be added in the future).

You must view your bank while the plugin is enabled for it to register what items you have. This data does not persist between client sessions so closing the client will require you to redo this step.
